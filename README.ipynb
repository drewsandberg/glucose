    "### Planted Crops\n",
    "These datasets tracks activities (e.g. planting and harvest dates, canopy measurements, crop observations, crop development milestones, etc.) and crop inputs (e.g. seed, fertilizer, chemicals, etc.) at the \"planted crop\" level. One or more planted crops can be planted on a land parcel (i.e. \"field\") and planted crops can be planted concurrently on the same field. When multiple planted crops are planted on a single field, this is generally called a \"split\" field. The purposes for splitting a field with more than one planted crop is typically to partition the filed for different varieties, or for research purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have included the Minnesota county in which the crop was grown as a reasonable proxy for the farm location.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variety**\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity and the rates of conversion of sucrose to glucose varies by variety. Variety must be a factor when considering building models to predict glucose values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emergence Dates**\n",
    "\n",
    "Emergence is defined as the date in which new plant foliage (\"canopy\") is visible above soil for at least 50% of the planted crop. Generally, emergence will have occurred 20 to 30 days after planting. If an emergence date is null, you can fill it in using either of the following approaches:\n",
    "- 25 days after planting\n",
    "- the average emergence date for all planted on that date within the specific county.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vine Kill Date**\n",
    "\n",
    "Vine kill dates reflect the date in which a dessicant was applied to any remaining \"green\" vegetation (i.e., plant material). The application of a dessicant stops the photosynthesis process and begins the process of thickening the tuber skin. A thicker skin helps protect the tuber from the damage (scuffing, small cuts, abrasions, skin/peel loss) which can happen during the harvest process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all fields are vine killed. Some planted crops may mature and senesce naturally; some planted crops are intentionally harvested with \"green vines\" still present in the field. Optimally, a planted crop is harvested no earlier than 14 days after vine kill -- thus giving time for the tubers to set a thicker skin. For planted crops with a *NULL* vine kill date, they should be left *NULL*. At this time, this dataset does not indicate if a planted crop's vegetation senesced naturally, died early due to pathogen(s), or if it was harvested \"green\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Harvest Start and Completion Dates**\n",
    "\n",
    "Harvesting a planted crop typically is done over a day or two, depending on the acres planted. In several cases, the number of days between start and completion of harvest can indicate weather delays, or may indicate a small portion of the crop was harvested early."

    "\n",
    "Changes in plenum temperatures are typically manipulated by adjusting environmental controls. \"Plenum air temperature\" is essentially temperature of the air supplied to the underside of the potato pile. The air is either supplied through perforated steel culverts (roughly 30\" to 36\" diameter) spaced every 6-8 feet and are placed perpendicular to building's longest axis. Here's an image which may help: https://idahopotato.com/uploads/foodserviceblog/2015/03/potaotes-going-into-storage-shed.jpg\n",

When the bin doors are closed, return air temps is a reasonable proxy for potato pile's average temperature. When bin doors are open, return temperatures can fluctuate. As a general approach, the goal is to maintain temperatures so that the return air is approximately 1 degree Farenheit warmer than the plenum temperatures.\n",

    "Sensor values should be evaluated within the context of their type. \"Fan Speed Percent\" will have a value between 0.0 and 1.0 and should be evaluated as a percent so that 0.45 is interpreted as 45% \"fan speed\". Similarily, carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are measured in parts per million (PPM) with values ranging from several hundered to several thousand. CO2 levels in fresh air range in teh 400 to 600 PPM. When CO2 values approach 2,000 PPM, the environmental control system will automatically adjust door openings to bring in more fresh air as high CO2 values for extended times can have detrimental impact to stored potatoes."

The four strips from the center of the sliced potato are retained and used for sugar testing. From each of those strips, only the stem-end 1/2\" is retained. The stem-end of the potato is where the tuber is attached to the plant's stolons; the greatest concentration of sugars are found in the tubers' stem-end. Sugar concentrations become more dilute further from the stem-end.\n",

As reference point, for Burbank variety, a sugar test returning sucrose values less than 0.5 grams/liter and glucose values less than 0.1 grams per liter will result in a near perfect fry color score of 0. \n",

Pay close attention to the storage bin environmental temperatures when this occurs as that indicates an optimal range for inducing that enzyme conversion process.

    "Weather information provided here has been retrieved from physical weather stations scattered around central Minnesota. Each planted crop is no more than 30 miles from a known physical weather station.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potato Days**\n",
    "In this dataset, Potato Days is a measurement of quality of growing conditions for potatoes. Potatoes neither like it too cool, nor too hot. When too warm or too cool, the tubers will not bulk (increase in size). The optimum temperature for bulking is between 48 and 74 degrees. Each day is graded on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 indicates the most positive growing/bulking conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize that a mature potoato crop will have total Potato Days, as measured from planting complete to the earlier of vine kill date, harvest complete, or September 10th, should be in the 950 to 1000 range.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference ET (Penman-Monteith Model)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"ReferenceETPenmanMonteith\" data point estimates the inches of water used per day by the crop either through evaporation, or transpriation. The Reference ET is referenced to a crop of grass which has a crop coefficient of 1.0. Potatoes have a evapotranspiration crop coefficient of 1.15, which means potato crops will consume roughly 15% more water through evapotranspiration over grass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evapotranspiration numbers can be summarized for the entire gowing season, but must be factored in with canopy growth. So, if by June 20th, a planted crop has an average canopy ground coverage of 60% and the Reference ET value is 0.25, then the adjusted evapotranspiration rate would be: 0.25 * 0.6 * 1.15 = .1725\" of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, in properly watered potato crops the sum of all irrigation water inches applied + measured rainfall equals the adjusted evaoptranspiration rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solar Radiation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"MegaJoulesPerMeterSquarePerDay\" data point quantifies the total downward solar radiation energy available to a planted crop. Like ET values, we like to calculate the sum of a planted crop's of intercepted solar radiation. Each day's solar radiation available must be factored by the canopy ground cover percentage. Generally speaking, more intercepted solar radiation will lead to larger yields as well as improved the crop's overall maturity."
